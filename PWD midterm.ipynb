    "\n",
    "The two most widely cited, and regularly updated estimates for the death toll from air pollution come from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the IHME’s Global Burden of Disease study. Their latest estimates are very close to each other – they estimate 7 million and 6.7 million deaths per year, respectively. These deaths are attributed to both indoor and outdoor pollution and – as explained below – stem from man-made and natural sources of air pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV file has information on the death rates for all countries in the world for the period 1990-2017. The death rate reports are divided into four main categories:overall death rate caused by air pollution,death rate caused by indoor pollution,death rate caused outdoor particulate matter and death rate caused by ozone outdoor pollution. This will make the analysis much more easir and efficient."

    "There has been an increase in death rate over the past few years due to air pollution.\n",
    "You will notice that the WHO estimates the total death toll to be lower than the sum of indoor and outdoor pollution deaths. This is because the deaths from risk factors are not summable. As the authors explain: “Some deaths may be attributed to more than one risk factor at the same time. For example, both smoking and ambient air pollution affect lung cancer. Some lung cancer deaths could have been averted by improving ambient air quality, or by reducing tobacco smoking.”4 Similarly the death of a particular person could have been averted by reducing the indoor or outdoor air pollution.\n",
    "In this context it is important to know that indoor air pollution – caused by people living in energy poverty – is one of the largest contributors to outdoor air pollution. The pollution generated in their homes also creates pollution outside the home. This means that these same populations often suffer from both, high indoor and high outdoor air pollution.\n",
    "I would like to develop comparison analysis on how each year there has been an increase or decrease of death rates due to air pollutionion, try to examine what factor has caused the death rates. This could aid me to assess my objectives by knowing what we can learn from the past years and try to take measurements to reduce air pollution and death rates and save the future generation.\n"

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

       " <li>The 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimate of 8.3 million premature deaths from pollution is likely a serious undercount.  The GBD data does not account for exposure to many forms of toxic pollution, including mercury, cadmium, chromium, radionuclides, and obsolete pesticides.</li>\n",
       " <li>What appears to be a decline in pollution deaths from a 2015 GBD estimate of 9 million deaths (reported in the 2017 Lancet Commission report) to the 2017 GBD estimate of 8.3 million deaths is due to changes in calculation methodologies, primarily related to air pollution.  New analyses, conducted by IHME’s air pollution experts, Health Effects Institute<strong>, </strong>reviewed the overlap between indoor air and outdoor air with new data and methodologies. Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>\n",

       " <li>The 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimate of 8.3 million premature deaths from pollution is likely a serious undercount.  The GBD data does not account for exposure to many forms of toxic pollution, including mercury, cadmium, chromium, radionuclides, and obsolete pesticides.</li>,\n",
       " <li>What appears to be a decline in pollution deaths from a 2015 GBD estimate of 9 million deaths (reported in the 2017 Lancet Commission report) to the 2017 GBD estimate of 8.3 million deaths is due to changes in calculation methodologies, primarily related to air pollution.  New analyses, conducted by IHME’s air pollution experts, Health Effects Institute<strong>, </strong>reviewed the overlap between indoor air and outdoor air with new data and methodologies. Changes were also made in modeling for various occupational pollutants and for lead. Each of these updated the IHME calculations.</li>,\n",
       " <strong>, </strong>,\n",
       " <li>Overall, the results show an improvement in the number of premature deaths from traditional types of pollution— sanitation and household air—from 2015 to 2017. But modern pollution, which is caused by industrialization and urbanization, is on the rise. Modern pollution, now responsible for 5.3 million deaths a year, is poorly addressed in development agendas. While attention is growing, the modern pollution crisis still lacks substantive focus within international development agencies.</li>,\n",
